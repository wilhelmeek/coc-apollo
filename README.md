# 🏹 coc-artemis

Apollo GraphQL Extension for `coc.nvim`.

Currently _this works_, but doesn't yet have any features beyond those already supported by most LSP clients.

> :warning: **The Apollo Language Server currently debounces code actions and auto-completions.** If you notice inconsistent behaviour, this may likely be the cause. See [this pull request](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling/pull/1593) if you're keen to fix.

## Install

`:CocInstall coc-artemis`

## Configuring

Relies on the presence of an `apollo.config.js` file in your workspace. See the [VSCode Extension Documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/editor-plugins/#setting-up-an-apollo-config) for more info.
