# coc-artemis

Apollo GraphQL Extension for `coc.nvim`.

Currently _this works_, but doesn't yet have any features beyond those already supported by most LSP clients. Issues/Pull Requests welcome to introduce additional functionality.

**NOTE**

`apollo-language-server` currently debounces code actions and autocompletions. If you notice inconsistent behaviour, this may likely be the cause.
